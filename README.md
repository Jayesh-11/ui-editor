    ui-editor is a web based interface builder built using reactjs. Its main purpose is to build interfaces for rapid application development.
  </p>
 <p>
    It started as an experimental tool to test readable code generation and it was a success. Since then, I have been experimenting with it to test instant renderer and it was a success too.

Most recently I tried to build a self editable compoment that can create children of itself and it worked. Checkit out the <a href="https://vimeo.com/464104903">recorded video</a> . It also comes with an option to edit the styles and it's interesting.
